  Essentially used for non - centralization of the tickets between the kiosks. There is a leader, chosen by default as C3 at first. This code represents the implementation of the Multipaxos using python and socket programming coded for Ticket buying kiosks.
  
  Inorder to run the code:
  
  Open 3 terminals and navigate it to the path where your python files are stored, then run the command, python3 tickets.py C1, C2 or C3.All the ip address for these clients are stored in the config.json file. And the config_fr_euca.json file has the ip addresses corresponding to the private instances which we created for our Eucalyptus environment.
